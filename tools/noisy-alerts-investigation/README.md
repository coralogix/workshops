# Coralogix Noisy Alerts Investigation Tool

A Python script to identify and analyze "noisy alerts" in Coralogix - incidents that open and close within a short time period, indicating they might be too sensitive or have incorrect thresholds.

## What are Noisy Alerts?

Noisy alerts are incidents that:
- Open and close very quickly (default: within 5 minutes)
- Often indicate overly sensitive alert thresholds
- Can create alert fatigue for your team
- May need threshold adjustments or alert rule tuning

## Features

- üîç **Fetches incidents** from Coralogix API using gRPC
- ‚ö° **Identifies noisy alerts** (configurable threshold, default: 5 minutes)
- üìä **Groups alerts by name** and shows count and last fired time
- üåç **Supports multiple Coralogix regions** (EU1, US2, etc.)
- ‚è∞ **Configurable time windows** and thresholds
- üìà **Easy-to-read output** with alert summaries

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- `grpcurl` command-line tool
- Coralogix API key with incidents service access

### Installation

1. **Install Python dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Install grpcurl:**
```bash
# macOS
brew install grpcurl

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install grpcurl

# Or download from: https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl/releases
```

### Usage

**Basic usage:**
```bash
# Set your API key
export CX_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# Run with default settings (EU1 region, 24-hour window, 5-minute threshold)
python find_noisy_alerts.py
```

**Advanced usage:**
```bash
# Specify region and API key
python find_noisy_alerts.py --api-key "your_api_key" --region "eu1.coralogix.com"

# Custom time window and threshold
python find_noisy_alerts.py --time-window-hours 48 --threshold-minutes 10

# Use environment variables
export CORALOGIX_REGION="eu1.coralogix.com"
export CX_API_KEY="your_api_key"
python find_noisy_alerts.py
```

## Underlying gRPC Command

The script uses `grpcurl` to communicate with the Coralogix API. Here's the underlying command structure:

### Basic gRPC Command
```bash
grpcurl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
        -d "{}" \
        ng-api-grpc.REGION.coralogix.com:443 \
        com.coralogixapis.incidents.v1.IncidentsService/ListIncidents
```

### Examples by Region

**EU1 Region:**
```bash
grpcurl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
        -d "{}" \
        ng-api-grpc.eu1.coralogix.com:443 \
        com.coralogixapis.incidents.v1.IncidentsService/ListIncidents
```

**US2 Region:**
```bash
grpcurl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
        -d "{}" \
        ng-api-grpc.us2.coralogix.com:443 \
        com.coralogixapis.incidents.v1.IncidentsService/ListIncidents
```

### Testing API Connectivity

You can test if your API key has access to the incidents service:

**List available services:**
```bash
grpcurl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
        ng-api-grpc.REGION.coralogix.com:443 \
        list
```

**Check if incidents service is available:**
```bash
grpcurl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
        ng-api-grpc.REGION.coralogix.com:443 \
        list | grep -i incident
```

### Troubleshooting gRPC Commands

**If you get "target server does not expose service":**
- Check that your API key has access to the incidents service
- Verify the region is correct
- Try listing available services to see what's accessible

**If you get authentication errors:**
- Verify your API key is valid
- Check that the key is for the correct region
- Ensure the key has the necessary permissions

## Command Line Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--api-key` | Coralogix API key | `CX_API_KEY` environment variable |
| `--region` | Coralogix region (e.g., eu1.coralogix.com) | `CORALOGIX_REGION` env var or "coralogix.com" |
| `--time-window-hours` | Time window in hours to look back | 24 |
| `--threshold-minutes` | Threshold in minutes to consider an alert as noisy | 5 |

## Supported Regions

- **EU1**: `eu1.coralogix.com` (Ireland)
- **US2**: `us2.coralogix.com` (Oregon)
- **Other regions**: Use the appropriate domain for your Coralogix instance

## Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues
- Ensure your API key has access to the incidents service
- Check that the key is valid for the specified region

### Region Issues
- Some regions may not have the incidents service available
- EU1 and US2 are confirmed to work with the incidents service

### grpcurl Issues
- Ensure grpcurl is installed and in your PATH
- Check that you can reach the Coralogix gRPC endpoints

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check your API key permissions** - Ensure it has access to the incidents service
2. **Verify your region** - Make sure you're using the correct Coralogix domain
3. **Test connectivity** - Try listing available services with `grpcurl`
4. **Contact Coralogix support** - For API access or service availability issues
