# Kamal: Deploy web apps anywhere

From bare metal to cloud VMs, deploy web apps anywhere with zero downtime. Kamal uses [kamal-proxy](https://github.com/basecamp/kamal-proxy) to seamlessly switch requests between containers. Works seamlessly across multiple servers, using SSHKit to execute commands. Originally built for Rails apps, Kamal will work with any type of web app that can be containerized with Docker.
